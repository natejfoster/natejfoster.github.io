Hello! I am Nathan Foster. I am a Junior with Senior standing here at UW…or is it third year Senior? Or maybe super Junior? I will just let administration team keep track of that and continue to enjoy the benefits of priority registration, without worrying about that too much. Regardless of class standing, I am currently pursuing a Batchelor's in Informatics, but my interests extend all the way from the physical circuitry of the hardware to the artistic design of the GUI. I come from the town of Tumwater Washington. For those of you that don't know where that is, just call it Olympia and you will be close enough. Where’s Olympia you ask? Well its not like it’s the Capital of Washington or anything, but I digress. In my spare time, you can find me climbing rocks and mountains, exercising my photography skills (I’m not hipster, I promise), playing any one of the 12 or so musical instruments I can play, or drinking coffee or tea while reading a book…ok maybe a little hipster, but I just like to call myself a Pacific Northwesterner. Come talk to me and I will let you decide what I am for yourself.
