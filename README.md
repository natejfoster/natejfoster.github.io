# a7 Portfolio

- This is my first portfolio! Its's super cool to think that in just about two months, I have developed the skills to create something that is functional and reflects my own design ideas. Anyone curious about what I have been working on in Info343 could view my projects on my website.

- My portfolio is live [here](http://students.washington.edu/njfoster/Info343/natejfoster.github.io/#/).

- I was sick when we went over using the React-Router in class, so I relied heavily on m16 exercise 1 to help me understand how to complete the project. Other than that, the usual Google searches, visits to w3schools, and peruse of the various documentations played their part.

- I would say 6 hours, but it might have been more. I spent some extra time working on a favicon, and putting some thought into the descriptions for my pages as well as my bio.

- Like I said earlier, missing class put me slightly behind on understanding the tools I needed to use. That was really the only problem I encountered, which is not inherent of the project itself. I also had three group assignments due in the span of three days ending on Sunday. This limited the time I had to work on the assignment. Furthermore, the creative element of the project, is leaving me uneasy. I feel that my style choices, such as color scheme and layout, reflect my own ideas, but it is hard for me to know if there are others that have used similar styles. Adding an interaction or animation would presumably have helped, but as I said, time was not on my side for this one.

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app).
